h3. Welcome!


This is a demo of GDoclet - an attempt at the simplest possible web CMS to Ruby using Google Docs to publish content on your website. Currently it is implemented as a Sinatra extension, but can easily be implemented for Ruby on Rails. Content is stored as Google Docs documents using "Textile":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile syntax. Documents must be “published” before they appear on the site - this allows you to create new versions of the document and only publish when ready. For this demo, automatic publishing is enabled to see changes straight away.
Currently there is basic caching of content which can be flushed on demand.
